  # Create expenses table

  1. New Tables
    - `expenses`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique identifier for each expense
      - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key) - References auth.users
      - `description` (text) - Description of the expense
      - `amount` (numeric) - Expense amount
      - `category` (text) - Expense category (e.g., supplies, fuel, equipment, etc.)
      - `expense_date` (date) - Date the expense occurred
      - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Timestamp of when the record was created
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz) - Timestamp of last update

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `expenses` table
    - Add policy for authenticated users to read their own expenses
    - Add policy for authenticated users to insert their own expenses
    - Add policy for authenticated users to update their own expenses
    - Add policy for authenticated users to delete their own expenses
