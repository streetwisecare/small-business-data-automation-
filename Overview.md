Project Overview

This project provides an automated data-management system designed for a small landscaping business.
The system helps keep business files organized, backed up, and easy to manage without requiring manual sorting.

The automation handles:

Sorting incoming business files (clients, invoices, expenses, schedules, reports)

Organizing them into a predictable folder structure

Creating scheduled backups with timestamps

Cleaning and maintaining system logs
