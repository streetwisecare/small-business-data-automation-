Project Overview

This project provides an automated data-management system designed for a small landscaping business.
The system helps keep business files organized, backed up, and easy to manage without requiring manual sorting.

The automation handles:

Sorting incoming business files (clients, invoices, expenses, schedules, reports)

Organizing them into a predictable folder structure

Creating scheduled backups with timestamps

Cleaning and maintaining system logs

Preventing data loss and keeping business information easy to find

This project simulates the type of automated systems used in professional service businesses like Jobber or QuickBooks, but built as a lightweight custom solution for a landscaping workflow.

✔ Eliminates messy or misplaced business files
✔ Reduces manual work by automating sorting and organizing
✔ Protects business data with regular backups
