## 🧭 Project Overview 

This project creates an automated data-management system for a small service business, using my landscaping company with example data as the example scenario.
The aim is to solve one real operational problem: business records are usually scattered, disorganized, and subject to loss. Such a situation makes it hard to manage schedules, invoices, expenses, reports, and historical records.

The following project automates three core areas:

File Organization

Incoming business files, such as client information, invoices, expenses, schedules, and reports, are automatically sorted into clear folder categories.

This helps to prevent clutter, decreases the risk of human error, and assures quick retrieval in case of an audit or a client request.

Automated Backups

The system generates time-stamped backup folders that copy all critical business files on a daily or weekly schedule.

This protects the company from:

Data loss

Device failure

Human error

Accidental deletion

Log Cleanup and Archiving

Old logs are automatically cleaned or archived to maintain storage efficiency.

This supports forensic readiness by preserving vital records while getting rid of unnecessary clutter.

Purpose of the Project

Small businesses rarely have IT staff or cybersecurity processes in place. This project shows how automation can:

Enhance data reliability

Support incident response readiness

Improve daily workflow efficiency

Reduce risk of data loss

Produce clean, well-structured logs and archives for forensic review.
Even though the system is designed around a landscaping business, the
concept applies to any small service-based company.

What the System Includes - 

Automatic folder creation and structuring

Automated file sorting rules 

Daily/weekly backup creation

Log cleanup + archiving workflow

Sample data (clients, invoices, expenses, schedules, reports)
