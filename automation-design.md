## Automation Design 

The automation system is designed to:

✔ Automatically sort business files (clients, invoices, expenses, schedules) into clean folders
✔ Generate regular backups to prevent data loss
✔ Remove or archive old logs to keep storage clean
✔ Provide a predictable structure for a small business workflow

## Folder Structure 

The automated system uses the following folder layout:

/Business-Data

    /Clients

    /Invoices
    
    /Expenses
    
    /Reports
    
    /Schedules
    
    /Backups
    
    /Logs
    
    /Incoming
