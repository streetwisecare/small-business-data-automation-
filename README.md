A small data-management system designed to keep a landscaping business organized.  
It automatically sorts important business files into clear folders, creates regular
backups to prevent data loss, and keeps old logs tidy so information stays easy
to find and manage.

files every day. This tool keeps those files organized and safely backed up so
the business never loses important information.

## ✨ Features
- Organizes business data into a clean, consistent folder structure  
- Creates daily backup copies to a safe location  
- Keeps older logs archived and tidy  
- Helps ensure important files can be restored when needed

📦 Data Storage, Database Structure & Privacy Controls

This section explains how the system stores business information, how the database is structured, and what privacy and security measures protect the data. This connects directly to cybersecurity concepts such as integrity, confidentiality, data retention, and forensic traceability.

1. How Information Is Stored

The project uses two layers of data organization:

A. Local File Storage (Automation System)

The automation scripts organize local business files into a consistent directory layout:

/Business-Data/
   /Clients
   /Invoices
   /Expenses
   /Reports
   /Schedules
   /Logs
   /Backups


Incoming files (CSV, JSON, PDF, images, etc.) are detected and sorted automatically into the correct folder based on keywords.

The website portion of the project uses a Supabase PostgreSQL database to store structured business data.

The database includes these tables:

Table	Purpose
clients	Basic customer information (name, contact, address, notes)
invoices	Invoice totals, payment status, due dates
expenses	Business costs such as supplies, gas, labor, etc.
reports	Job summaries and work logs
schedule	Appointments and upcoming jobs

Each record is stored with:

UUID primary keys

Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

User/session tracking

Validated schema rules

This ensures data is not lost, altered incorrectly, or corrupted.
