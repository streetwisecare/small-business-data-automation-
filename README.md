# Small Business Data Automation

## 🌐 Live Website Access
https://fieldflowmanager.org/

A small data-management system designed to keep a landscaping business organized.  
It automatically sorts important business files into clear folders, creates regular
backups to prevent data loss, and keeps old logs tidy so information stays easy
to find and manage.

---

## 🌿 Purpose
Landscaping businesses generate photos, invoices, job notes, schedules, and other
files every day. This tool keeps those files organized and safely backed up so
the business never loses important information.

## ✨ Features
- Organizes business data into a clean, consistent folder structure  
- Creates daily backup copies to a safe location  
- Keeps older logs archived and tidy  
- Helps ensure important files can be restored when needed

## 📦 Data Storage, Database Structure & Privacy Controls

This section explains how the system stores business information, how the database is structured, and what privacy and security measures protect the data. This connects directly to cybersecurity concepts such as integrity, confidentiality, data retention, and forensic traceability.

1. How Information Is Stored

The project uses two layers of data organization:

A. Local File Storage (Automation System)

The automation scripts organize local business files into a consistent directory layout:

/Business-Data/
   /Clients
   /Invoices
   /Expenses
   /Reports
   /Schedules
   /Logs
   /Backups

Incoming files (CSV, JSON, PDF, images, etc.) are detected and sorted automatically into the correct folder based on keywords.

## 🌐 Database Storage (Web App)

The website portion of the project uses a Supabase PostgreSQL database to store structured business data.

The database includes these tables:

Table	                  Purpose
clients	               Basic customer information (name, contact, address, notes)
invoices	               Invoice totals, payment status, due dates
expenses                Business costs such as supplies, gas, labor, etc.
reports	               Job summaries and work logs
schedule                Appointments and upcoming jobs

Each record is stored with:

UUID primary keys

Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

User/session tracking

Validated schema rules

This ensures data is not lost, altered incorrectly, or corrupted.

## 🔐 Data Integrity 
Some of the Data Integrity Controls Include

Schema Validation

Each table defines valid data types (e.g., text, numeric, date).
Invalid entries are rejected automatically.

Timestamps

Every change is recorded with exact time, which is important for:

Tracking updates, Forensic reconstruction, Log correlation

Predictable File Naming

Example:

invoice_2025-01-03_ClientName.pdf  
expense_fuel_2025-01-10.csv  
schedule_2025-01-17.json


Predictable filenames allow:

Easy indexing

Automated sorting

Quick discovery during audits

It Even Has Automated Backups

The system generates timestamped backup directories, ensuring files are never overwritten.

## 📡 Privacy & Security 

## Access Control (Least Privilege)
## Supabase enforces Row-Level Security (RLS):

Only authenticated users can read or modify data
API keys and session tokens restrict access
No anonymous viewing of client or business information

## Encrypted Communication

All communication is done over HTTPS, ensuring:

Data is encrypted in transit

Client info cannot be intercepted

Attackers cannot sniff credentials

## Encrypted Storage (At Rest)

Supabase uses encryption for stored database information, so even if someone accessed the raw data layer, it would be protected.

## Minimal Data Retention / Privacy Compliance

The system does not store unnecessary information.
This follows modern privacy principles:

Data minimization

Purpose limitation

Retention control

Sensitive personal information (SSN, credit card numbers, etc.) is not stored, reducing liability.

## Backup & Recovery (Disaster Recovery)

The automation system creates safe backups:

/Backups/YYYY-MM-DD/
   /Clients
   /Invoices
   /Expenses
   /Reports
   /Schedules


These Backups protect against:

Accidental deletion
Corrupt files
System crashes
Ransomware
Human error
